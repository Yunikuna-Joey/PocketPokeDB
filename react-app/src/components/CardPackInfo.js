    /* 
        Tentative Plan: 
        --> Load in only the Parent name for the booster packs (i.e Genetic Apex, Promotional Pack A)
        
        Option #1
            --> The booster pack tile will then lead to the different faces (if any) 
            --> Then another click into the face pack 
            --> Then display all the cards available 
            
        Option #2 [Idea is less clicks on this]
            ==> initial click will then bring us to a page all of the cards available
            ==> we will have the abiltiy to search and filter 
            ==> just need a good way of displaying the cards now...
